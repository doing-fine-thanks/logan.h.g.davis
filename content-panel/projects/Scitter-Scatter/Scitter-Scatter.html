    Serialism and directness are all strengths that writing holds over casual
    conversation. Traditionally, writing flows in one direction, moving to its
    next point moving forward in a path the reader can shortcut by moving their
    eyes further down the page without the writing having a say in how itâ€™s engaged
    with.  For writing about dyslexia, inconsistent memories, or tangential conversation,
    these traits undermine anything other than a clinical overview or second-person narrative.
