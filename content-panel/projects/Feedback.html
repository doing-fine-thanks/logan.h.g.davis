<h1> Statement: </h1>
<p>
    In 2016 and 2017 after reading <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/sonic-possible-worlds-9781623565091/">Salom√© Voegelin's </a><i>Sonic Possible Worlds</i></a> and
    <a href="https://www.bloomsbury.com/us/in-the-blink-of-an-ear-9780826429711/">Seth Kim-Cohen's <i>In The Blink of An Ear </i></a> I conducted a series of recording
    sessions where I would approach a stranger and ask them to listen to an audio track.
    I would prompt them to describe what they were hearing as the track continued to play.
    The tracks were then sorted by the audio track used as the prompt and compiled.
</p>
<p>
    The resulting audio a composite of overlaid experiential narrative trying to make
    sense and relate to audio they had no context for. The tracks act as an archive of
    perspective and interpretations of shared material.
