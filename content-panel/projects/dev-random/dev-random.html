<p>
    A collection of works done through text manipulation and (genetic) AI <br>
    generated imagery to display a computer's ability to produce randomness with intent  <br>
    and with reckless abandon. <br>
</p>
<p>
    Randomness in interaction with art can either lend an emergent  <br>
    uniqueness surprise for the artist or generate static that undermines  <br>
    any conversation one can have with it. The art of making meaningful  <br>
    work in the digital age is knowing an individual component's contribution to <br>
    this signal-to-noise ration of an entire piece. <br>
