<h1> Statement: </h1>
<p>
    Verna is a documentary both of my family maternal family history and of my grandmother's story telling.
    There have been prior attempts to catalog the story of how the family ended up in Jutland, New Jersey,
    but each attempt failed because one simple fact: a lot of people were doing a lot of things, all at
    the same time.

    My grandmother has been the wrangler of these narrative threads. Her stories weave in between decades,
    countries, and center figures. Her weaving of these events makes it evident that no codex could
    convey the tapestry of lives that landed my family were they are.

    This project builds on the structure-as-tangent principles I used in projects like <a href="Scitter-Scatter/Scitter-Scatter.html"><i>Scitter Scatter</i></a>.
    Its tangents are crafted so any ending is a valid one, so this non-linearity is exploration, not
    failure (like it is in other interactive video projects such as Netflix's <i>Bandersnatch</i>).

    The structure, which will be talked about in greater depth in the technical section, takes inspiration
    from Italo Calvino's <i>Invisible Cities</i>. Though rather than a conversation that moves either by
    conversational-order or by city, the traversal of this video moves conversational-order or by semantic
    subject (Sam Barlow's <i>Immortality</i>).
