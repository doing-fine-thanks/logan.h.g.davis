<p><b>Bio:</b></p>
<p>
Hi, my name is Logan Davis. I'm an artist and software developer
living in Austin, TX.
</p>
<p>
My work is in creating maps and networks that connect in ways
other than time, and space; objects that act as polymorphic
material for distinctly separate ides. I lean into occurrences of
multiplicity, shared vernacular, or metaphor as a means to archive
with less concern for hierarchy and more reverence for relation.
</p>
<p>
I graduated from <a href="https://marlboro.emerson.edu">Marlboro College</a>
in 2017 with a BA in Programming  languages, was software researcher for
<a href="https://www.synopsys.com/software-integrity/security-testing/software-composition-analysis.html">Black Duck</a>
software, and have since been working as a systems architect for Pairity AI (recently acquired by <a href="https://finvi.com">Finvi</a>).
