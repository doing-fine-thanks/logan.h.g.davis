<p><b>Bio:</b></p>
<p>
Hi, my name is Logan Davis. I'm an artist and software developer.
</p>
<p>
My practice is grounded in creating maps and networks that connect in ways
other than time and space; objects that act as polymorphic
material for distinctly separate ideas. I lean into occurrences of
multiplicity, shared vernacular, and metaphor as a means to archive
with less concern for hierarchy and more reverence for relation.
</p>
<p>
    I graduated from <a href="https://marlboro.emerson.edu">Marlboro College</a>
    in 2017 with a BA in Programming Languages and current work as
    a systems architect for Pairity AI (recently acquired by <a href="https://finvi.com">Finvi</a>).
    I can be found making ceramics, photos, and multimedia projects in Austin, TX.
